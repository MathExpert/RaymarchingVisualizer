# RaymarchingVisualizer

Basic raymarching visualizer that I made in the far away 2011 for my Computer Graphics course at university.
Doesn't use shaders, so it is quite slow.
Supports basic primitives, boolean operations, Phong lighting and reflections.

Sometime I might clean up the code, update it to C++11 and liberate it from Visual Studio.
